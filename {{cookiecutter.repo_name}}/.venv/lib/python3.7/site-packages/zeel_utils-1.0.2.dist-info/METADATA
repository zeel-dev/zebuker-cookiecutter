# zeel-utils

A package to be used across services to add util functions to each of the services. It was noticed that same util functions were being repeated throughout each of the services, thus this package came to be.

date_utils:

- convert_to_utc
- next_weekday

# How to upload to private Pypi

1. On your machine, make sure that the AWS command line is installed by running `aws help` in your terminal (if its not, install it)
2. Run the command `open ~/.aws/credentials`, if you don't have this file, do `touch ~/.aws/credentials`.
3. Copy and paste the following code (and replace the `[value]` parts):

```
[zeel/PyPICloud]
region = us-east-1
aws_access_key_id = [value]
aws_secret_access_key = [value]
```

(you can get the values from 1password — search for `PyPICloud` and you should find the entry)

4. Samuel is currently deploying a domain, pypi.zeel.com, where our private packages will be stored (it’s simply an S3 bucket with a CloudFront distribution in front of it)
5. The website should ask you for credentials that you can find on 1password again (search for `pypi.zeel.com`)
6. for publishing packages onto the repository, use the helper command line tool s3pypi (specifically running the command `s3pypi --bucket pypi.zeel.com --profile zeel/PyPICloud` at the root of your project/package) _For this to work, your project should contain a setup script. The official Python documentation contains a detailed guide on creating the setup script, and on distributing packages in general here_ https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/setupscript.html
7. for installing packages from that repository, use the following command `pip install --extra-index-url https://pypi.zeel.com/{PACKAGE_NAME}` (edited)
